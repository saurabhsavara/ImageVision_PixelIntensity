# ImageVision_PixelIntensity

# Pixel Intensity

##

## **Project description**

In this program, you will develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) capable of performing transformative operations on images. This program should be capable of performing the following transformations: negative, bit-plane, binary_,_ _log, power-law/gamma, linear, piecewise-linear, arithmetic operations_ (image addition, subtraction, and multiplication/division_), __set operations_ (complementation, union, intersection, and difference_), __thresholding_, and _logical__operations_ on binary images (AND, OR, NOT, XOR). The program should display the transformed image and allow the user to save the new image if they desire.

**Requirements**

**Language Platform**

Python= =3.7 or above

## **How to Run Program:**

Following the instructions below to run this program.

After installing the requirements into your virtual environment. Run *python PixelIntensity.py*
